<h3>Protect Your Online Store From Fraud with 3-D Secure</h3> 

CardinalCommerce (a wholly owned subsidiary of Visa) offers a rules-based 3-D Secure (3DS) solution called Cardinal Consumer Authentication. Protect your web store from fraud, reduce false declines, reduce manual review of orders, and improve your authorizations. 

Supports Verified by Visa (VbV), Mastercard SecureCode/Identity Check, Discover ProtectBuy, and American Express Amex Safekey.

<h3>Activate Cardinal Consumer Authentication to Comply with PSD2 SCA</h3>

If you sell to consumers in the European Economic Area (EEA), and use acquiring services in the EEA, then you will be required to comply with the PSD2 requirement for Strong Customer Authentication (SCA). Your online store must support SCA for all digital transactions starting September 14, 2019. (Mastercard will require issuers, merchants, and acquirers to support SCA in the EEA starting in April, 2019.)

EEA countries include Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the UK.

<h3>How 3-D Secure Solves for SCA</h3>
EMV® 3-D Secure (commonly known as 3DS 2.0) authenticates Card-Not-Present transactions to reduce fraud and false declines, and to increase good orders, with a better checkout experience for consumers. The PSD2 SCA requirement can be fulfilled by 3-D Secure because it works on any device and enables two-factor authentication.

<h3>Why Cardinal Consumer Authentication is THE Merchant Solution</h3>
Cardinal Consumer Authentication is an industry-leading solution for merchants to authenticate digital transactions, leveraging 3-D Secure. CCA balances the risk of the transaction with the consumer experience and authenticates most transactions behind the scenes. There is no consumer impact or interruption to the checkout process in most cases, and CCA uses consumer-friendly challenge methods to limit friction when necessary.
